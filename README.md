# 🍎 ApplePie Game

Welcome to **ApplePie**, a fun and simple word-guessing game written in Swift! This project is part of a Swift programming exercise to understand the fundamentals of UIKit, MVC architecture, and user interaction in iOS development.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

ApplePie is a word-guessing game similar to Hangman:
- The player is given a hint (e.g., number of letters in the word).
- The player selects letters to guess the word.
- For each wrong guess, a slice of the apple pie disappears!
- The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.

## 💡 Features

- Simple and intuitive UI
- Built using UIKit
- Follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern
- Teaches basics of Swift logic and event handling
